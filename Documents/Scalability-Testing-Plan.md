# Scalability & Reliability Testing Plan

This plan outlines how to validate the scalability and reliability of a CRDT-based real-time backend service.

---

## 1. Define Test Objectives

| Goal             | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**  | Measure system performance as user/room count increases   |
| **Reliability**  | Validate availability and correctness under load/failure  |
| **Latency**      | Monitor response time and sync speed                      |
| **Consistency**  | Ensure CRDT states are consistent across clients          |
| **Fault tolerance** | Check recovery from crashes, reconnects, etc.         |

---

## 2. Prepare the Test Environment

- Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes for deployment
- Include Redis for pub/sub and potential CRDT persistence
- Set up monitoring:
  - Prometheus + Grafana
  - Structured logs (Pino/Winston)
  - Sentry for crash/error reporting
- Use load testing tools:
  - Artillery (WebSocket load)
  - Locust (customizable concurrent clients)

---

## 3. Load Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Connection Load

**Goal:** Determine how many concurrent WebSocket clients the server can handle.

- Users: 1,000 → 10,000
- Rooms: 3–100
- Messages/sec: 1 per client
- Tools: Artillery

---

### Test 2: Message Throughput

**Goal:** Stress-test message rates per room.

- Users: 100–500 per room
- Message sizes: small, medium (JSON), large (CRDT binary)
- Message rate: 5–10/sec/client
- Duration: 5–10 minutes

Metrics:
- Delivery latency
- Server CPU/RAM
- Message loss

---

### Test 3: CRDT Sync Consistency

**Goal:** Ensure CRDT states are synchronized across clients.

- Random client edits
- Compare Automerge state via `Automerge.equals(clientA, clientB)`

---

### Test 4: Room Lifecycle Stress

**Goal:** Test room creation, usage, and cleanup under load.

- Create 1000+ rooms
- Cycle clients in/out (join/leave)
- Reconnect 50% of clients randomly

---

### Test 5: Failure Recovery

**Goal:** Test behavior under network and system failures.

| Scenario              | Expected Behavior                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Redis crash           | Server recovers or gracefully degrades      |
| Socket.IO crash       | Clients reconnect, CRDT state persists      |
| Network lag           | Sync resumes after recovery                 |
| Server killed         | Other instance takes over (if clustered)    |

---

## 4. Observe & Measure Key Metrics

| Metric                  | Tool/Method               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| WebSocket connection count | Prometheus + Socket.IO |
| Memory/CPU per room     | Docker stats, Node profiler |
| Message latency         | Server logs + timestamps |
| CRDT sync size          | Automerge metrics/logging |
| Error/disconnect rate   | Sentry, custom logging    |

---

## 5. Set Performance Thresholds

| Component         | Threshold                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Message latency  | < 100ms under 500 users               |
| CRDT convergence | 100% sync across peers                |
| Clients/node      | 5,000–10,000                         |
| Room recovery     | < 3 seconds                          |
| Redis pub/sub lag | < 100ms                              |

---

## 6. Analyze Results & Tune

- Export metrics to Grafana dashboards
- Tune:
  - Heartbeat intervals
  - Snapshot frequency
  - CRDT compaction
- Document pain points and scale limits

---

## Summary Table

| Goal         | Tool/Method                  |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Load testing | Artillery        |
| CRDT checks  | Automerge state comparison   |
| Observability | Prometheus + Grafana        |
